💬 Six Sigma Yellow Belt Interview Questions & Answers

Beginner + Intermediate + Advanced (30 Questions Total)

# 🟡 Beginner Level – 10 Questions
1. What is Six Sigma?

Answer:
Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology used to reduce defects, improve quality, and make processes more efficient.

2. What does a Yellow Belt do?

Answer:
A Yellow Belt supports improvement projects, collects data, performs basic analysis, and assists Green/Black Belts.

3. What is DMAIC?

Answer:
DMAIC stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control — a structured method used to solve process problems.

4. What is a Process?

Answer:
A process is a set of steps that convert inputs into outputs to deliver a product or service.

5. What is Variation?

Answer:
Variation refers to differences in process results. Six Sigma aims to reduce variation for consistent outcomes.

6. What is a Defect?

Answer:
A defect is any result that fails to meet customer requirements or expectations.

7. What is a SIPOC Diagram?

Answer:
SIPOC stands for Supplier, Input, Process, Output, Customer — a high-level tool to understand process flow.

8. What are the 7 Wastes in Lean?

Answer:
Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects.

9. What is a Fishbone Diagram?

Answer:
A cause-and-effect tool used to identify root causes of a problem.

10. What is a Control Chart?

Answer:
A chart used to monitor process stability over time using upper and lower control limits.

# 🔵 Intermediate Level – 10 Questions
11. What is Voice of Customer (VOC)?

Answer:
VOC represents customer needs, expectations, and preferences collected through surveys, feedback, and interviews.

12. Difference between Defect and Defective?

Answer:

Defect: A single flaw.

Defective: An item with one or more defects that fails acceptance criteria.

13. What is DPMO?

Answer:
Defects Per Million Opportunities — a metric that measures process performance.

14. Explain Pareto Principle.

Answer:
80% of problems arise from 20% of causes. It helps prioritize improvement areas.

15. What is FMEA?

Answer:
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis — a tool to identify risks, evaluate impact, and prioritize mitigation.

16. Difference between Lean and Six Sigma?

Answer:

Lean: Removes waste.

Six Sigma: Reduces variation.
Together they form Lean Six Sigma.

17. What is Measurement System Analysis (MSA)?

Answer:
A method to evaluate if the measurement system is accurate, precise, and reliable.

18. What is a Baseline?

Answer:
The initial performance level of a process before improvements.

19. What is Process Capability (Cp/Cpk)?

Answer:
Statistical measures showing how well a process meets customer specifications.

20. What is a Kaizen Event?

Answer:
A short, focused improvement workshop aimed at making quick, practical changes.

# 🔴 Advanced Level – 10 Questions
21. What is Hypothesis Testing in Six Sigma?

Answer:
A statistical method used to check whether observed differences are due to chance or actual process changes.

22. What is Root Cause vs. Symptom?

Answer:

Symptom: The visible problem.

Root Cause: The underlying reason the problem occurs.

23. What is Regression Analysis?

Answer:
A statistical technique used to understand relationships between variables and predict outcomes.

24. What is a Control Plan?

Answer:
A documented plan that outlines how process performance will be monitored and controlled after improvements.

25. What is Design of Experiments (DOE)?

Answer:
A structured method to test multiple factors simultaneously to identify the best combination for performance.

26. What is a p-value?

Answer:
A probability value that indicates whether results are statistically significant.
Lower p-value (<0.05) = significant difference.

27. What is Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ)?

Answer:
The total cost incurred due to defects, rework, scrap, delays, and customer dissatisfaction.

28. What are Control Limits vs. Specification Limits?

Answer:

Control Limits: Determined by the process; used in control charts.

Specification Limits: Determined by customer requirements.

29. What is a Project Charter?

Answer:
A document defining the project purpose, scope, goals, timeline, and team roles.

30. What is Normal Distribution?

Answer:
A bell-shaped statistical distribution where most values cluster around the mean.
